Bona Fides:-
==========

Mac webdevelopment setup script.
This is my personal OSX Lion initialisation script, setting up many used tools.
As i didn't find many scripts, and most people use Mamp or Webstart, i decided to build my own and share it.
If you have suggestions, please create an issue on Github.

What does Bona Fides install?
=============================
- PHP 5.4.0
- MYSQL 5.5.23
- Drush (Latest)
- Pear (Latest)
- GCC 10.7-v2 (without using XCode)
- Git 1.7.9.4
- Homebrew (Latest)

For Apache we are using the version that comes with OSX.
We use a standalone GCC (osx-gcc-installer) from kennethreitz instead of needing to install the 'way too big XCode'.
See https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer

How to?
=======

Warning:- This scrip will download a few hundred megabytes of files while executing.


- On a fresh mac install, install git, See at following link to download the DMG. http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list
- Open terminal.app
- Clone the Github repo with following command: (just copy and paste in terminal and hit enter)
 
  git clone https://betz@github.com/betz/bona-fides.git

- When done, enter the folder you just created with cloning the repo. Do this with following command:
 
  cd bona-fides

- Make the setup.sh file executable with next command:

  chmod +x setup.sh

- Start the setup:

  ./setup.sh
  
- You can safely remove the bona-fides folder in your home folder with finder.

That's it!


When asked for your password, enter your mac user password and hit enter.
It is normal that you dont see your cursor moving when typing a password.
Follow instructions as you see them. (it will ask to hit enter few times).

Just tap enter when you are being asked questions ;)
